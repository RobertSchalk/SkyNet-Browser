# SkyNet Browser

Todo:
tie URL bar to the individual tabs. Currently getting a DOM warning. Url bar and controls only work with the first tab so far.


A browser I decided to challenge myself to create using the electron framework.

Basics are working, currently building tabs, and having them communicate with the tag.
After that, I will be working on creating a window for the bookmarks.
