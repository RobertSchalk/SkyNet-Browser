# SkyNet Browser


V0.0.6<br/>
<br/>
SkyNet is a cross-platform browser that I've decided to create as a personal project. My goal is to create a browser that people can enjoy. It has a relatively classic, but modern-fun appeal.  <br/>
<br/>
**What I am currently working on:** <br/>
I'm currently working on creating the Favorites bar, and folders for favorites. I'm still working on implementing a fully functional settings page. Once I have the favorites bar and the themes portion complete, I will be looking at implementing browser history. Once I complete this, I should be able to release the browser for a full release.  

I plan on adding apps to the browser one it's finished.
